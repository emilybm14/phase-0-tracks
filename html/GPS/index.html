			<p>Reflection
				<ol>
					<li>The purpose of semantic tags is to give context to the visible HTML code. It can also help with displaying elements of a page for those with disabilities.</li>
					<li>Browsers read and then displays html from the top down.</li>
					<li>I learned aboout creating sublime snippets as well as the proper place to put the footer. I had originally thought that it should be place below the body. I definitely think that snippets will be useful in the future.</li>
					<li>figuring out how to create a snippet and the purpose was the most challenging task for me in this exercise. I think that practice/ repitition will be the best way for me to get better.</li>
